# Update Packages

A linux script that will update packages using various package managers

This project is for personal use and is just being shared to inspire others. It might need to be changed for your specific use case.

## pip

I don't recommend updating all python packages that are outdated. Some developers push more experimental updates as a release. Only update the packages that you installed yourself instead. The dependencies will be updated when needed. Or just use [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) instead of pip. It's faster and solves conflicting dependencies for you.
